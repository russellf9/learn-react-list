## Facebook Open Source Docs

[react](https://reactjs.org/) - The documentation is very clear.

The thought process required for building in React is vert well explained in [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

Which basically covers the following steps providing good codepen examples for each stage:

* Start With a Mock
* Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
* Step 2: Build A Static Version in React
* Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
* Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live
* Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow
